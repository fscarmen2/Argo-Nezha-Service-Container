## Project Features.
* Wider scope of application --- As long as there is a network connection, Nezha server can be installed, such as LXC, OpenVZ VPS, Nas Virtual Machine, Container PaaS, etc.
* Argo tunnel breaks through the restriction of requiring a public network portal --- The traditional Nezha requires two public network ports, one for panel visiting and the other for client reporting, this project uses Cloudflare Argo tunnels and uses intranet tunneling.
* IPv4 / v6 with higher flexibility --- The traditional Nezha needs to deal with IPv4/v6 compatibility between server and client, and also needs to resolve mismatches through tools such as warp. However, this project does not need to consider these issues at all, and can be docked arbitrarily, which is much more convenient and easy!
* One Argo tunnel for multiple domains and protocols --- Create an intranet-penetrating Argo tunnel for three domains (hostname) and protocols, which can be used for panel access (http), client reporting (tcp) and ssh (optional).
* GrpcWebProxy reverse proxy gRPC data port --- with a certificate for tls termination, then Argo's tunnel configuration with https service pointing to this reverse proxy, enable http2 back to the source, grpc(nezha)->GrpcWebProxy->h2(argo)->cf cdn edge->agent
* Daily automatic backup --- every day at 04:00 BST, the entire Nezha panel folder is automatically backed up to a designated private github repository, including panel themes, panel settings, probe data and tunnel information, the backup retains nearly 5 days of data; the content is so important that it must be placed in the private repository.
* Automatic daily panel update -- the latest official panel version is automatically detected every day at 4:00 BST, and updated when there is an upgrade.
* Manual/automatic restore backup --- check the content of online restore file once a minute, and restore immediately when there is any update.
* Default built-in local probes --- can easily monitor their own server information
* More secure data --- Argo Tunnel uses TLS encrypted communication to securely transmit application traffic to the Cloudflare network, improving application security and reliability. In addition, Argo Tunnel protects against network threats such as IP leaks and DDoS attacks.

## Prepare variables to be used
* Visit the Cloudflare website, select the domain name you want to use, and turn on the `network` option to turn the `gRPC` switch on.

* Get github authentication license: https://github.com/settings/applications/new

Add `https://` to the beginning of the panel's domain name and `/oauth2/callback` to the end of the callback address.

* Create a private github repository for backups: https://github.com/new

## How to get Argo authentication: json or token
Argo tunnel authentication methods include json and token, use one of the two methods. The former is recommended because the script will handle all the Argo tunnel parameters and paths, while the latter needs to be set manually on the Cloudflare website and is prone to errors.

### (Methods 1 - Json):
#### Easily get Argo tunnel json information through Cloudflare Json Generation Network: https://fscarmen.cloudflare.now.cc

### (Methods 2 - Token): Manually generate Argo tunnel token information via Cloudflare website.
#### Go to the cf website: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
* Go to zero trust and generate token tunnel and message.
* The data path 443/https is proto.
* ssh path 22/ssh for < client id >.

```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fscarmen2/Argo-Nezha-Service-Container/main/dashboard.sh)
```


## Client Access
Transfer via gRPC, no additional configuration required. Use the installation method given in the panel, for example
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naiba/nezha/master/script/install.sh -o nezha.sh && chmod +x nezha.sh && sudo ./nezha.sh install_agent data.seales.nom.za 443 eAxO9IF519fKFODlW0 --tls
```


## SSH access
* Take macOS + WindTerm as an example, and other SSH tools depending on the one used, combined with the official documentation: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use_cases/ssh /#2-connect-as-a-user
* Official cloudflared download: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases
* The following are examples of input commands.
  SSH user: root， SSH password：<GH_CLIENTSECRET>
```
<filepath>/cloudflared access ssh --hostname ssh.seals.nom.za/<GH_CLIENTID>
```

## Automatically restore backups
* Change the name of the file to be restored to `README.md` in the github backup repository, the timer service will check for updates every minute and record the last synchronized filename in the local `/dbfile` to compare with the online file content.

The following is an example of restoring a file with the name `dashboard-2023-04-23-13:08:37.tar.gz`.

## Manually restore the backup
* ssh into the container and run, tar.gz filename from the github backup repository, format: dashboard-2023-04-22-21:42:10.tar.gz
```
bash /dashboard/restore.sh <filename>
```
<img width="1209" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92626977/233792709-fb37b79c-c755-4db1-96ec-1039309ff932.png">


## Migrating data
* Backup the `/dashboard` folder of the original Nezha and zip it up to `dashboard.tar.gz` file.
```
tar czvf dashboard.tar.gz /dashboard
```
* Download the file and put it into a private repository, the name of the repository should be exactly the same as <GH_REPO>, and edit the contents of README.md of the repository to `dashboard.tar.gz`.
* Deploy the new Nezha in this project, and fill in the variables completely. After the deployment is done, the auto-restore script will check every minute, and will restore automatically if it finds any new content, the whole process will take about 3 minutes.
